labrad-manager
==============

Python implementation of labrad manager.  This requires an up-to-date
version of pylabrad from martinisgroup/pylabrad on github.  This
should still be considered experimental, but is intended to serve as a
testing area for new labrad features such as new types, more efficient
data protocol, and so forth.
