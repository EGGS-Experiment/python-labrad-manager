Labrad manager tasks:

Notes:
pylabrad 0.92 types;

1.0, Value(1.0), Value(1.0, None) -> 'v'
Value(1.0, ''), (1.0*GHz / (1.0*GHz)) -> 'v[]'

Labrad manager converts v-> target units, but v[] is explicitly dimensionless

pylabrad servers don't include type tags on unflatten, so handleRequest
expects records without type tags.  sendPacket can accept records with type
tags, but does not require them.


TODO: 
Core:
	Optimize unit conversion for arrays using numpy
	Behavior to test:
       	    rejecting incompatible type tags
            converting i,w,b types (?)
    	Check exceptions when shutting down manager
    	clean up debugging print statements PARTIAL

GUI:
    Sort ID numerically instead of lexically
    
In memory server:
       Get/set blacklist/whitelist:  Implemented but not accessible
       Make sure all names are case insensitive but case preserving
       Manipulate whitelist from server interface
       Prohibit dropping registry connection

Registry:
	Separate process registry needs to get path from command line
	performance test with/without fsync() -- possibly need separate thread for registry so sync() doesn't block manager
	Stop relying on garbage collection to clean up directory contexts
	Test compatibility with delphi registry dir

Optional:
	Make registry optional

Performance optimization:
	Do endian conversion without full unflattening 
	Avoid unflattening completely for remote servers
	PARTIAL: lazy lists are not unflattened if contents don't 
      	       require unit/type/endian conversion.  Still need 
	       optimization to unflatten as numpy array for
      	       unit conversion -- IN PROGRESS, see types.py / TransformingBuffer
    
      detect when endianness / unit conversions allow it.  For
      	     simplicty, only allow direct communication for 
	     big-endian clients and servers  that don't require unit conversion
      Change flatteing to use buffer API to avoid reallocation -- DONE


DONE:
    Convert units -- DONE
    Accept connections, check whitelist handle signon -- DONE
    Convert endiennes -- DONE
    add default client index to zero context -- DONE
    how are settings registered?  message or request? -- DONE
    Manage list of connected clients/servers -- DONE
    When client disconnects:
        Send context expiration to serve -- DONE

    utility functions (unit conversion, flatten/unflatten, help) -- DONE
    Manipulate server setting lists -- DONE
    Handle named signal subscriptions -- DONE

    Allow gui-free startup -- Avoid QT dependency entirely DONE
    Generate error response on sendPacket failure DONE
    Get unit type conversion working (to extent supported by pylabrad) DONE

    Save/restore whitelist DONE
    Prohibit dropping manager connection DONE
    Enforce blacklist DONE

    Make registry files end with newline DONE
    Make all file writes atomic  DONE
    Make registry get path from cfg object when invoked from manager DONE
    Use delphi compatible format DONE

    Try PyPy (without QT) -- DONE Poor performance for some reason

avoid extra flattening/unflattening for in-memory servers (probably not helpful since the in-memory servers are not performance critical)
Allow extra in-memory servers -- Probably not particularly helpful

Would be cool:

peer-to-peer server with built-in manager -- only big-endian (?) -- won't help qubit sequencer easily

How to make peer-peer work:
    server registers with manager as p-p capable, gives IP and port
    client asks manager for connection token
    connect to server with API v2.1, provides connection token
    	    connection token = hmac(client ID + sequence number (?), server secret token)
    server asks manager to validate connection token, or does so automatically
    server must validate input data and do unit conversions

version 2.1:
	support version negotiation
	Big endian only
	No 'v' tag
	support 64 bit integer (tag=L)
	manager doesn't do unit conversion
	Allow p-p
